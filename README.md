</p>

- **Blazing fast**: The whole reason `req` was made is because of the lack of
  fast API testing tools.
- **Feature packed**: `req` has all the features you can expect from a modern
  HTTP client. And if something is missing, just
  [let me know!](https://github.com/SiddharthShyniben/req/issues).
- Beautiful output
- Beautiful documentation
